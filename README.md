👋 Hello there! I'm Arin Soni, a software enthusiast from IIT Bombay 🎓.

💻 I love diving into the world of coding and exploring new technologies. My main areas of interest include software development, machine learning, and data science. I enjoy building innovative solutions and tackling complex problems.

🏓 When I'm not coding, you can often find me on the table tennis court, honing my skills and competing in friendly matches. It's a great way to stay active and have fun!

🎮 I'm also an avid gamer, and I enjoy playing video games in my spare time. Gaming allows me to unwind, immerse myself in exciting virtual worlds, and connect with friends through multiplayer adventures.

🌟 Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at IIT Bombay, where I'm honing my skills in computer science and engineering. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact on society.

🚀 Outside of academics, I actively participate in coding competitions and hackathons, where I get to collaborate with fellow developers and learn from their expertise. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest advancements in the tech industry.

🌐 Besides coding and gaming, I also enjoy contributing to open-source projects. I believe in the power of collaboration and the open-source community's ability to drive innovation.

📫 If you'd like to connect, collaborate, or have a chat about technology, gaming, or table tennis, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always excited to meet new like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities.

Let's build something awesome together! 😄
